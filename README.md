# My Dotfiles
**For linux configuration**

**NOTE**: Dotfiles should be in their own folder, under version control, and **symlinked** into place using a script.

**NOTE**: Use `./linux/setup_all.sh` to configure the environment automatically.

## RandomQuotes

**NOTE**: If you want to connect to a remote host via sftp or scp, the .bashrc of the remote host should not have any echo statements, otherwise it will fail to connect. So don't use randomquotes in this case.

`cp ./randomquotes.sh ~/.randomquotes`

Add `source ~/.randomquotes` to the end of `~/.bashrc `
